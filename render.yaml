    # Auto-restart behavior:
    # - Render automatically restarts services that exit with non-zero code
    # - Service exits with code 1 on errors/panics, triggering auto-restart
    # - Service exits with code 0 only on graceful shutdown (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
    # - UptimeRobot monitors /health endpoint separately
